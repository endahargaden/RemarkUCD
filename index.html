# You can do big reveals in slides

--

A simple "dash-dash" in your code 
--
results 
--
in 
--
an illusion 
--
of the big reveal.

--

Great to emphasize something of import.

## Try getting the _Countdown_ theme in beamer


Which country has comparative advantage in coffee?

|  | Production Possibilities |
|--|-- |
| Indonesia | 640 phones **or** 2000 cups of coffee |
| Colombia  | 890 phones **or** 1800 cups of coffee |

# These alerts are a good way to break up the slides.

# UCD has a branding guideline

And this guidline has favourite colours.

These can be used very easily. .color1[Very easily.] .color2[Very easily.]

.color3[Very easily.] .color4[Very easily.] .color5[Very easily.]

# It is easy to include small images

## This slide has a nice split-screen approach 

.pull-left[
This text can explain the elements on the right.

That is, to the extent that anyone can explain him.

## This slide has a nice split-screen approach 

.split-left[
Sometimes it is useful to adjust the relative widths of the left- and right-splits in case you have text that runs on too long, for example if you are including a paper abstract and want to include the face of the person as well. I believe there is evidence that including an author's photo next to a description of their work makes it more memorable for the students.

## Could Portugal benefit from trading with an inferior nation?

--

## **YES!**

--

Suppose England spends all its time on shirts, and .green[Portugal] spends 90% of its resources on wine.

--

England produces 1000 shirts and 0 wine. Portugal produces 120 shirts and 45 litres of wine. .hl[(Why?)]

--

Then there is 1,120 shirts total and 45 litres of wine.

--
That's more of **both goods**!

### This also allows math in our favourite markup language

$$ -b \pm \sqrt{ \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{2a}} $$

And with confidence:

$$ CI = \bar{x} \pm 1.96 \times se/\sqrt{n} $$

## It is very easy to incorporate videos

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xUf5cIUV6DY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>

### And, if we want, interactive graphs

<iframe src="dynamic_img.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none" />

# HTML has lots of little bits that are useful.

I don't just mean **bold**, _italic_, or .u[underlined] text.

<details><summary>.color3[Click me for an example]</summary>GDP is the sum of all value-added in an economy &#128512;</details>

Keep it interactive.
