# RemarkUCD
A simple UCD theme for remark.js slides

1. This is a template for UCD remark.js slides.

2. remark.js is a script that converts simple commands into slides. For example, a new slide is created by entering "---" on a line by itself. See https://remarkjs.com/ for details.

3. You can view the source code of index.html to see the full set of codes. Using the # symbol creates a large heading, using ## makes a slightly smaller heading, and so on.

4. I have specified style_ucd.css to pick the right colours and so on. There is also logo_ucd.png.

5. The other files (countdown.mp3, daron.jpg, and dynamic_img.html) are external files showing some examples of what remark can do.
